        <p id="img-caption">Stan Lee was an American comic book writer, editor, publisher, and producer.
            He rose through the ranks of a family-run business to become Marvel Comics' primary creative leader for two
            decades,
            leading its expansion from a small division of a publishing house to a multimedia corporation that dominated
            the comics industry.
            In collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writer/artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he
            co-created numerous popular fictional characters,
            including superheroes Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Black Widow, the Fantastic Four,
            Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch and Ant-Man.
            The superheroes he created seemed more meaningful and realistic.</p>
